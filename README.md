<h1>Portfolio</h1>
A collection of scripts I've developed over the years.

<h2>Cyber-Security</h2>
<h3>Python</h3>
Here we have three Python scripts that I was proud of at the time of completion. Personally, my favourite is oauth_scanner.py as I believe it is structured well.
<h3>Bash</h3>
There are two Bash scripts here. Though I don't use Bash as often as Python, I believe the scripts there demonstrate an understanding of the concept of automation programming.

<h2>Web-Dev</h2>
If the index.html file is opened in browser (and the directory structure matches that of this repo) we will see a PoC website I developed roughly 2 years ago.
<h3>Fruits Slice Game | Maths Game</h3>
These are accessible from index.html. Two very simple PoC JavaScript games.
<h3>Pure_CSS_PoC</h3>
A simple web interface developed using pure CSS (no jQuery etc.) Not accessible from index.html.

<h2>University</h2>
<h3>Python</h3>
Here are several Python scripts I had to work on as part of university.
<h3>Java</h3>
<h4>Book.java | Library.java</h4>
Part of an assignment for university, very basic but demonstrates key principles (OOP, lambdas, streams, collection methods (etc))


<h2>Game Programming In Cpp</h2>
I began working through Game Programming In C++ by Sanjay Madhav. Although I didn't follow each chapter religiously, it was a good start for knowing the general process of developing a game and it did introduce me to OpenGL while also allowing me to begin learning C++.
<h3>Chapter One</h3>

Chapter one walks you through the creation of the game PingPong and provided you with two optional exercises- add 2 player functionality and add a multiball feature. 
I didn't enable 2 player as this basically just involves duplicating code but I did enable a multiball feature which will generate 1-5 balls of random positions and velocities. This directory holds the source code for this game, excludingthe SDL2 library.

<h3>Chapter Three</h3>

Here we are talked through the creation of Asteroids and given the tasks to create circular collision detection and implement Newtonian physics (via semi-implicit Euler integration)
My contribution to the code is within MoveComponent, CollisionComponent and Ship- I'm aware there could be improvements (such as a more realistic mass-speed ratio or further logic to account for collisions when the ship is invisible) but I am satisfied that the objectives of the chapter have been met. 

<h3>OpenGL - Getting Started</h3>

In preparation for developing an engine for my first 2D game, I've been working through OpenGL's Getting Started tutorials (https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/OpenGL) This directory simply holds code from working through those.
Not neccessarily a display of skill- more a display of learning. :)
