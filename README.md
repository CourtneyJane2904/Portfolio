<h1>Portfolio</h1>
A collection of scripts I've developed over the years.

<h2>Cyber-Security</h2>
<h3>Python</h3>
Here we have three Python scripts that I was proud of at the time of completion. Personally, my favourite is oauth_scanner.py as I believe it is structured well.
<h3>Bash</h3>
There are two Bash scripts here. Though I don't use Bash as often as Python, I believe the scripts there demonstrate an understanding of the concept of automation programming.

<h2>Web-Dev</h2>
If the index.html file is opened in browser (and the directory structure matches that of this repo) we will see a PoC website I developed roughly 2 years ago.
<h3>Fruits Slice Game | Maths Game</h3>
These are accessible from index.html. Two very simple PoC JavaScript games.
<h3>Pure_CSS_PoC</h3>
A simple web interface developed using pure CSS (no jQuery etc.) Not accessible from index.html.

<h2>University</h2>
<h3>Python</h3>
Here are several Python scripts I had to work on as part of my first year of university.
