"""
Answer to problem: If n = 1, the algorithm can immediately return false. For every prime n > 1, 1 and n are the two factors. The algorithm searches for a third factor from 2 to floor( âˆšn ) and returns false if it finds one. If the end of the loop is reached, n is prime.

because if n = a * b and a <= b
then a * a <= a * b = n
